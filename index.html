        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Crystal. </p>

        <p>I love learning new skills, figuring out how things work, and enjoy building/fixing things, including anything from DIY craft kits to a leaky pipe under the bathroom sink. This curiosity and urge to create largely drives my inspiration in learning how to code. I'm grateful I got to spend my college years hanging out on boats, at beaches, and trekking through salt marshes studying marine biology. </p>

        <!-- still trying to find these insert photo took on the dock from class or at beach  -->

        <p>I then spent most of my career in customer service and now aspire to transition to a career in tech. In my free time, you might find me reading (I LOVE books), taking photos (my favorite way to shoot is on 35mm film with my Nikon F3), solving puzzles, playing video games, watching movies/TV, or crocheting.</p>

        <!-- photo of some completed crochet pieces? stack of some books? -->

        <p>Personal philosophy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There's no such thing as too many books.</li>
          <li>It's never too late to learn something new.</li>
        </ul>
